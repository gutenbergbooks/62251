  <a id="spring"></a>IN EARLY SPRING<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  O Spring, I know thee!  Seek for sweet surprise<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the young children's eyes.<br />
  But I have learnt the years, and know the yet<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaf-folded violet.<br />
  Mine ear, awake to silence, can foretell<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cuckoo's fitful bell.<br />
  I wander in a grey time that encloses<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;June and the wild hedge-roses.<br />
  A year's procession of the flowers doth pass<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My feet, along the grass.<br />
  And all you wild birds silent yet, I know<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notes that stir you so,<br />
  Your songs yet half devised in the dim dear<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginnings of the year.<br />
  In these young days you meditate your part;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have it all by heart.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I know the secrets of the seeds of flowers<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidden and warm with showers,<br />
  And how, in kindling Spring, the cuckoo shall<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alter his interval.<br />
  But not a flower or song I ponder is<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own, but memory's.<br />
  I shall be silent in those days desired<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before world inspired.<br />
  O all brown birds, compose your old song-phrases,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth, thy familiar daisies!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A poet mused upon the dusky height,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between two stars towards night,<br />
  His purpose in his heart.  I watched, a space,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of his face:<br />
  There was the secret, fled from earth and skies,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hid in his grey young eyes.<br />
  My heart and all the Summer wait his choice,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wonder for his voice.<br />
  Who shall foretell his songs, and who aspire<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to divine his lyre?<br />
  Sweet earth, we know thy dimmest mysteries,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is lord of his.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
  <a id="beloved"></a>TO THE BELOVED<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Oh, not more subtly silence strays<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst the winds, between the voices,<br />
  Mingling alike with pensive lays,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the music that rejoices,<br />
  Than thou art present in my days.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  My silence, life returns to thee<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the pauses of her breath.<br />
  Hush back to rest the melody<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That out of thee awakeneth;<br />
  And thou, wake ever, wake for me!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Thou art like silence all unvexed,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though wild words part my soul from thee.<br />
  Thou art like silence unperplexed,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A secret and a mystery<br />
  Between one footfall and the next.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Most dear pause in a mellow lay!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art inwoven with every air.<br />
  With thee the wildest tempests play,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And snatches of thee everywhere<br />
  Make little heavens throughout a day.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Darkness and solitude shine, for me.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For life's fair outward part are rife<br />
  The silver noises; let them be.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the very soul of life<br />
  Listens for thee, listens for thee.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O pause between the sobs of cares;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O thought within all thought that is;<br />
  Trance between laughters unawares:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art the shape of melodies,<br />
  And thou the ecstasy of prayers!<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
  <a id="festival"></a>AN UNMARKED FESTIVAL<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  There's a feast undated, yet<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both our true lives hold it fast,&mdash;<br />
  Even the day when first we met.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a great day came and passed,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Unknown then, but known at last.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And we met: You knew not me,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mistress of your joys and fears;<br />
  Held my hand that held the key<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the treasure of your years,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the fountain of your tears.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For you knew not it was I,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I knew not it was you.<br />
  We have learnt, as days went by.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a flower struck root and grew<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underground, and no one knew.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Day of days!  Unmarked it rose,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In whose hours we were to meet;<br />
  And forgotten passed.  Who knows,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was earth cold or sunny, Sweet,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the coming of your feet?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  One mere day, we thought; the measure<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such days the year fulfils.<br />
  Now, how dearly would we treasure<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something from its fields, its rills,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its memorable hills.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
  <a id="autumn"></a>IN AUTUMN<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The leaves are many under my feet,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drift one way.<br />
  Their scent of death is weary and sweet.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flight of them is in the grey<br />
  Where sky and forest meet.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The low winds moan for dead sweet years;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds sing all for pain,<br />
  Of a common thing, to weary ears,&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a summer's fate of rain,<br />
  And a woman's fate of tears.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I walk to love and life alone<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over these mournful places,<br />
  Across the summer overthrown,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead joys of these silent faces,<br />
  To claim my own.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I know his heart has beat to bright<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet loves gone by;<br />
  I know the leaves that die to-night<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once budded to the sky;<br />
  And I shall die from his delight.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O leaves, so quietly ending now,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You heard the cuckoos sing.<br />
  And I will grow upon my bough<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only for a Spring,<br />
  And fall when the rain is on my brow.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O tell me, tell me ere you die,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it worth the pain?<br />
  You bloomed so fair, you waved so high;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the sad days wane,<br />
  Are you repenting where you lie?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I lie amongst you, and I kiss<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your fragrance mouldering.<br />
  O dead delights, is it such bliss,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That tuneful Spring?<br />
  Is love so sweet, that comes to this?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Kiss me again as I kiss you;<br />

  O mother, for the weight of years that break thee!<br />
  O daughter, for slow time must yet awake thee.<br />
  And from the changes of my heart must make thee!<br />

  O fainting traveller, morn is grey in heaven.<br />
  Dost thou remember how the clouds were driven?<br />
  And are they calm about the fall of even?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Pause near the ending of thy long migration,<br />

  Suffer, O silent one, that I remind thee<br />
  Of the great hills that stormed the sky behind thee,<br />

  Know that the mournful plain where thou must wander<br />

  What part of this wild heart of mine I know not<br />
  Will follow with thee where the great winds blow not,<br />

  Yet let my letter with thy lost thoughts in it<br />

  Oh, in some hour of thine thy thoughts shall guide thee.<br />

  Telling thee: all thy memories moved the maiden,<br />

the light, not towards it.  Before Tintoretto's date, however,
many painters practised shadows and lights, and turned more or

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewells!"  O what a word!<br />
  Denying this agony, denying the affrights,<br />
  Denying all De Quincey spoke or heard<br />
  In the infernal sadness of his nights.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How mend these strange "farewells"?<br />
  "Vale"?  "Addio"?  "Leb'wohl"?  Not one but seems<br />
  A tranquil refutation; tolling bells<br />
  That yet behold the terror of his dreams.<br />

</h3>

<p class="poem">
  You bid me hold my peace,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or so I think, you birds; you'll not forgive<br />
  My kill-joy song that makes the wild song cease,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent or fugitive.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Yon thrush stopt in mid-phrase<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At my mere footfall; and a longer note<br />
  Took wing and fled afield, and went its ways<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the blackbird's throat.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Hereditary song,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illyrian lark and Paduan nightingale,<br />
  Is yours, unchangeable the ages long;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assyria heard your tale;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Therefore you do not die.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But single, local, lonely, mortal, new,<br />
  Unlike, and thus like all my race, am I,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preluding my adieu.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  My human song must be<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My human thought.  Be patient till 'tis done.<br />
  I shall not hold my little peace; for me<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no peace but one.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Home, home from the horizon far and clear,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hither the soft wings sweep;<br />
  Flocks of the memories of the day draw near<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dovecote doors of sleep.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Oh, which are they that come through sweetest light<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all these homing birds?<br />
  Which with the straightest and the swiftest flight?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your words to me, your words!<br />
